A pluggable search engine designed to find alternative copies of textbooks.
Allows you to plug in a python module that provides textbook data for your
institution, then indexes that data in elasticsearch and lets people search for
books. It will try to find alternatives through various means. At the moment it
only searches the Internet Archive, and Open Library, however the plan is to
refine it to find better matches.
